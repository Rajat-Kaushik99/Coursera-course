                <p>
                   White Hat hackers are also known as Ethical Hackers. They never intent to harm a system, rather they try to find out weaknesses in a computer 
                   or a network system as a part of penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.
                   Ethical hacking is not illegal and it is one of the demanding jobs available in the IT industry. 
                   There are numerous companies that hire ethical hackers for penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.

                <p>
                   Black Hat hackers, also known as crackers, are those who hack in order to gain unauthorized access to a system and harm its operations or steal sensitive information.
                   Black Hat hacking is always illegal because of its bad intent which includes stealing corporate data, violating privacy, damaging the system, blocking network communication, etc.

                <h2>Grey Hat Hackers</h2>
                <p>
                   Grey hat hackers are a blend of both black hat and white hat hackers. They act without malicious intent but for their fun, they exploit a security weakness in a computer system or network without the ownerâ€™s permission or knowledge.
                   Their intent is to bring the weakness to the attention of the owners and getting appreciation or a little bounty from the owners.
